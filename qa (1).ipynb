            "the political structure of western europe changed with the end of the united roman empire. although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. such movements were aided by the refusal of the western roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. the emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as stilicho (d. 408), aspar (d. 471), ricimer (d. 472), or gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-roman background. when the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. intermarriage between the new kings and the roman elites was common. this led to a fusion of roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the roman state. material artefacts left by the romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on roman objects. much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on roman intellectual traditions. an important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. this meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. slavery declined as the supply weakened, and society became more rural.[f]\n",

            "the deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. the number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] these may form zones of gradation known as clines. indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. this is known as hybrid vigor. the existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger, which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between european and indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and american bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as beefalo. there is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. there are exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. however, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed. clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in north america. as many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy, a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate.\n",

            "regarding the timing of german rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of maxim litvinov, whose jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by nazi germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with germany. stalin immediately directed molotov to \"purge the ministry of jews.\" given litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with france and britain, and pro-western orientation by the standards of the kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a soviet option of rapprochement with germany.[f] likewise, molotov's appointment served as a signal to germany that the ussr was open to offers. the dismissal also signaled to france and britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with germany. one british official wrote that litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" carr argued that the soviet union's replacement of foreign minister litvinov with molotov on may 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with germany, but rather was stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the british and the french by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely molotov, to the foreign commissariat. historian albert resis stated that the litvinov dismissal gave the soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced german negotiations, but that they did not abandon british–french talks. derek watson argued that molotov could get the best deal with britain and france because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with germany. geoffrey roberts argued that litvinov's dismissal helped the soviets with british–french talks, because litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.\n",
